* General provisions
LN (*L* anguage of *N* ormal Markov algorithms) is a _rule-oriented_ and _evolutional_ programming language.

** Rule-oriented programming
Rule-oriented (RO) programming is a programming paradigm which fundament is normal algorithms. All programm, or it's parts, builded as combination of _substitution rules_ and _source states_.

Typical RO programming languages is a _Thue_, _MarkovJunior_ and _REFAL_.

** Evolutional programming
Evolutionary programming is a programming paradigm in which a program is represented as a combination of rules (conditions) and one initial state (seed). Unlike RO programming, evolutionary programming represents a program as a developing organism, to each new state of which new rules are applied. The program can thus develop independently, regardless of the developer.
