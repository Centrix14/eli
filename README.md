# ELI
ELI is an Early (and Experimental) LN Interpreter.

## Goals
Goals of ELI is provide fully, user-friendly and powerful interpreter of LN language. It must be _powerful_, but not _fast_.  
Also, ELI is a testing platform. ELI makes relization of new LN features more easy.

## Code style
As you can see (i hope you can see), ELI written in Literal Programming technique. Why? Because:
1. I need some practise in LP.
2. In my oppinion, LP makes code more understandable and clear, than comments, clean code and another strange staff.

## Project status
Now ELI in deep development. I can code only in my free time, but since i become a student, i barely haven't free time.
